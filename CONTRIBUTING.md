## How to Add Your Editorial

- Place your solution(s) and corresponding editorial in the appropriate folder (see [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)).
- Include both the code file (e.g., `.py`, `.cpp`) and a Markdown explanation (e.g., `problem_a.md` or `A_Soup_Explanation.md`).
- If you're unsure where to add your file, ask a maintainer or open an issue.

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Branch name:** `add/{short-description}` (e.g., `add/week-2-segment-tree-editorial`)
- **Editorial Markdown file:**  
  - For weekly problems: `problem_{letter}.md` (e.g., `problem_a.md`)
  - For contest problems: `{ProblemCode}_Explanation.md` (e.g., `A_Soup_Explanation.md`)
- **Code file:**  
  - Use the original problem code and language extension (e.g., `problem_a.cpp`, `A_Soup.py`)
- **Folders:**  
  - Use lowercase and hyphens for week/topic folders (e.g., `week-2-dp/`)
  - For practice contests: `practice-contest-{number}-{date}/` (e.g., `practice-contest-1-2025-09-01/`)
